UML diagrams
You can render UML diagrams using Mermaid. For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:

Alice
Bob
John
Hello Bob, how are you?
How about you John?
I am good thanks!
I am good thanks!
Bob thinks a long
long time, so long
that the text does
not fit on a row.
Checking with John...
Yes... John, how are you?
Alice
Bob
John
And this will produce a flow chart:

Link text
Square Rect
Circle
Round Rect
Rhombus
