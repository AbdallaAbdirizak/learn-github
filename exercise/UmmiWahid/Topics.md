## 2. Cashless Payment Adoption in Malaysia:  A Quantitative Approach

# What: 
The problem statement highlights how countries compete to demonstrate technological advancement as an indicator of development, particularly focusing on how technology raises living standards and improves countries' economies. Therefore, compared to certain other nations, Malaysia is said to have a somewhat low adoption rate for cashless payment methods. In Malaysia, cash is still used for a big percentage of transactions even though there are a lot of credit and debit cards in use. Furthermore, it has been observed that Malaysia's e-wallet adoption rate is still low, which has been identified as a barrier to the country's goal of becoming a cashless society.

# Why: 

1. Lack of Knowledge: A large number of Malaysians may prefer traditional cash transactions because they are unaware of the advantages and convenience of cashless payment methods.

2. Limited Acceptance by Retailers: Although the use of mobile devices is growing, some Malaysian retailers have not completely embraced cashless or digital payment methods, which may impede the general adoption of these strategies.

3. Consumer Behaviour: Due to habits or worries about security and privacy when it comes to digital transactions, some customers may still prefer to make cash transactions.

4. Regulatory Environment: The rate at which cashless payment methods are adopted in Malaysia may be impacted by the necessity of strengthening national laws and policies to support electronic commerce and guarantee the security of cashless transactions.
