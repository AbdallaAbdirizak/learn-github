Hi, I'm Marco Chin, a passionate software engineer from Malaysia. I love learning about new technologies and creating innovative solutions for real-world problems. I have experience in software development, system administration, Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERPs), and blockchain. Currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. In my free time, I enjoy writing articles on my blog, sharing my knowledge with others, and also exploring and contributing to open-source projects.
