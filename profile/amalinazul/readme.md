Hi, I'm Amalina, from Johor Bahru. I love learning about new technologies and creating innovative solutions for real-world problems. I am a curious soul with a passion for learning and exploring the world. Whether it’s diving into a new book, experimenting with a recipe in the kitchen, or embarking on an adventure, I thrive on discovery. Currently, I'm pursuing PhD in Health Science at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. In my free time, I enjoy writing articles on my blog, sharing my knowledge with others, and exploring and contributing to open-source projects too.

## Skills 🛠️

Data Analysis: Skilled in data wrangling, visualization, and drawing insights from messy datasets.
Creative Writing: Whether it’s crafting short stories, poems, or witty tweets, words are my playground.
Photography: My lens captures moments, emotions, and the beauty of everyday life.
Problem Solving: I thrive on dissecting complex problems and finding elegant solutions.

## Work Experience 💼

- I have worked for several companies over the last couple of years, starting in 2021 where I took an intern role at Pelican International, a procurement company based in Kampala. I then worked on a number of projects with Inter Miles, Code Sync and also did several projects under the mentorship of [Chris Kateera](https://github.com/chris-kck) built on [Frappe Framework: Open Source Low Code Framework](https://frappeframework.com). More recently, I worked at AfroFleet Technologies (South Africa) and Bitcoin Innovation Hub (Uganda) before resuming my studies here at UTM.
